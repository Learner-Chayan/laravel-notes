**************MODEL NOTES ***************************
++++
If your model's corresponding database table does not fit this convention, you may manually specify the 
model's table name by defining a table property on the model:
 ---
    class Flight extends Model
    {
        protected $table = 'my_flights';
    }

++++
created_at and updated_at - 
f you do not want these columns to be automatically managed by Eloquent, you should define a $timestamps 
property on your model with a value of false:
 ---
     class Flight extends Model
    {
        public $timestamps = false;
    }

++++
Customize date format 
    protected $dateFormat = 'U';


+++
Database connection - 
By default, all Eloquent models will use the default database connection that is configured for your 
application. If you would like to specify a different connection that should be used when interacting 
with a particular model, you should define a $connection property on the model:
 ---
 class Flight extends Model
{
    protected $connection = 'sqlite';
}
